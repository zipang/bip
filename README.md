bip - Background Images Preloader
=================================

Purpose
-------
Background images are great. They are repeatable, and maybe even tilable, so they can offer great impact for a few bucks.

However, there is a little glitch in all that awesomeness : you dont know when they are loaded.

There is no onload event on background images,
Well.. unless you use `bip` (_Background Image Preloader_)

The purpose of `bip.preload()` is to give you a way to react as soon as some background images are loaded, via a CSS hook (a class name) or a JavaScript callback.
